### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to help users understand and find patterns in data of UFO sightings. A variety of visualizations and ways to compare them should allow a user to draw various conclusions about what types of UFO sightings are reported, and correlate them with:
- Geographical Location
- Date
- Time of Year (such as by month, season, day of week, etc.)
- Length of Reported Encounter
- Time of Day
- Words used to describe encounter
